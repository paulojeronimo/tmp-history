[.big.text-center]
*Sometimes you may want a location to share a temporary file with the following
conditions:*

. The file should be associated with one of your known public domains.
.. In my case, the domain {uri-my-domain}.
. The file name could be automatically generated for you, via a script, with a
small length and random characters.
. The file could be encrypted. Ideally, you would use software like {GPG} for
this.
. Only you should be capable of removing the file.
. Whenever you add, update or remove a file in this location, a file
`changes.txt` stating the changes were made should be updated.
.. This file should be audited by the command `git log` so you can see, at any
time, what modifications were made in the place.

[.big.text-center]
*This project helps you to achieve the conditions above using {GitHubPages}!*

The {tmp} git repository always contains a single commit and many temporary
files. This repo can also have <<bash-scripts,Bash scripts>> and other files
that are persistent in another git repository ({tmp-history}). So, for the
{tmp} repository, don't expect you can make a clone of it, thinking you'll pull
it later because that won't work. In technical words:

[subs=attributes+]
----
$ git clone {uri-tmp-github} # <- it works!
$ git pull {uri-tmp-github}  # <- will not work!
----

The files generated in this repository are accessible through the URL
https://your-github-name.github.io/tmp/.

NOTE: In my case, {uri-ghpages-custom-domain}[I configured GitHub Pages as my
custom domain]. So, my `tmp` repo is available here: {uri-tmp}.

*The SHA256 of the temporary files* stored here keeps alive (and constantly
updated) in
{uri-tmp-history}/blob/main/changes.txt[tmp-history/blob/main/changes.txt].
So, you can audit if there was any change in the files pointed out by it.

All the files that are not temporary in the {tmp} repository are also available
in the repository {tmp-history} with a history of changes associated with them.

[[bash-scripts]]
[.big.text-center]
*This is the list of the scripts available (in alphabetical order):*

* link:generate-random-file.sh[] -> this script is responsible for creating a
file with a random and unique name in this directory. Possibly, the contents of
this file will be encrypted via {GPG}.
* link:publish-to-gh-pages.sh[] -> this script is responsible for recreating
the {tmp} repository every time it is called.
* link:README.build.sh[] -> this script rebuilds this page (`index.html`).
* link:update-history.sh[] -> this script is called by `publish-to-gh-pages.sh`
and is responsible to update the repository {tmp-history} by copying any
persistent files that were changed to it and by generating the file
`changes.txt`.

[.big.text-center]
*Use cases of the scripts above:*

.You want to generate a random file to use it in your script
[%collapsible]
====
----
$ ./generate-random-file.sh
----

To specify the size (length) of the file name use:

----
$ size=5 ./generate-random-file.sh
----

To remove the generated temporary files that have no content, type:

----
$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size 0 -delete
----
====

.You want to publish the contents of your directory `tmp`
[%collapsible]
====
----
$ ./publish-to-gh-pages.sh
----
====

.You want some files that you put in {tmp} available in {tmp-history}
[%collapsible]
====
This way they will no longer be temporary and your change history will remain
there (in {tmp-history}).

----
$ cp file1 file2 ../tmp-history
----

NOTE: In the `update-history.sh` script, the `history_dir` variable also points
to a `tmp-history` inside the parent directory of `tmp` repository. So, if your
`tmp-history` directory have a different name, you need to configure this
variable.
====

.You want to rebuild this page (`index.html`) using your own variables
[%collapsible]
====
Create a  file named `my-variables.adoc` and configure the AsciiDoc attributes
`uri-my-*`. This is a sample of how to do this:

----
$ cat > my-variables.adoc <<EOF
:uri-my-domain: https://my-user.github.io/
:uri-my-github: https://github.com/my-user
EOF
----

Rebuild the `index.html` with this command:

----
$ ./README.build.sh
----
====
