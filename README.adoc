*Sometimes you may want a location to share a temporary file with the following
conditions:*

. The file should be associated with one of your known public domains.
ifndef::env-github[]
In my case, the domain {uri-my-domain}.
endif::[]
. The file name could be automatically generated for you, via a script, with a
small length and random characters.
. The file could be encrypted. Ideally, you would use software like {GPG} for
this.
. Only you should be capable of removing the file.
. Whenever you add, update or remove a file in this location, a file
{changes-txt} stating the changes were made should be updated.
.. This file should be audited by the command `git log` so you can see, at any
time, what modifications were made in the place.

[.big.text-center]
*This project helps you to achieve the conditions above using {GitHubPages}!*

The `tmp` git repository always contains a single commit and many temporary
files. This repo can also have <<bash-scripts,Bash scripts>> and other files
that are persistent in another git repository (`tmp-history`). So, for the
`tmp` repository, don't expect you can make a clone of it, thinking you'll pull
it later because that won't work.
ifndef::env-github[]
In technical words:

[subs=attributes+]
----
$ git clone {uri-tmp-github} # <- it will always works!
$ git pull {uri-tmp-github}  # <- it may not work!
----
endif::[]

The files generated in this repository are accessible through the URL
https://your-github-name.github.io/tmp/.

ifndef::env-github[]
NOTE: In my case, {uri-ghpages-custom-domain}[I configured GitHub Pages as my
custom domain]. So, my `tmp` repo is available here: {uri-tmp}.
endif::[]

*The SHA256 of the temporary files* stored here keeps alive (and constantly
updated) in `tmp-history`/blob/main/changes.txt (on GitHub).
So, you can audit if there was any change in the files pointed out by it.

All the files that are not temporary in the `tmp` repository are also available
in the repository `tmp-history` with a history of changes associated with them.

[[bash-scripts]]
[.big.text-center]
*This is the list of the scripts available (in alphabetical order):*

* link:fork.sh[] -> this script creates a fork of the repository `tmp-history`
to you.
* link:generate-random-file.sh[] -> this script is responsible for creating a
file with a random and unique name in this directory. Possibly, the contents of
this file will be encrypted via {GPG}.
* link:generate-tmp.sh[] -> this script generates the `tmp` git repository.
* link:publish-to-gh-pages.sh[] -> this script is responsible for recreating
the `tmp` repository every time it is called.
* link:README.build.sh[] -> this script rebuilds this page (`index.html`).
* link:update-history.sh[] -> this script is called by `publish-to-gh-pages.sh`
and is responsible to update the repository `tmp-history` by copying any
persistent files that were changed to it and by generating the file
{changes-txt}.

*Use cases of the scripts above:*

.You want to fork this project to start using it
[%collapsible]
====
* Step 1 -> Create the Git repositories `tmp-history` and `tmp` in your GitHub
account. Leave them blank because they will be filled in the next steps.
* Step 2 -> Use the link:fork.sh[] script. It will clone the `tmp-history` from
an existing origin. Type:
+
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulojeronimo/tmp-history/main/fork.sh)
----
* Step 3 -> Go to the generated `tmp-history` directory, created in the step
above, and call the script link:generate-tmp.sh[]
+
----
$ cd tmp-history
$ ./generate-tmp.sh
----
* Step 4 -> Start using your `tmp` directory to store temporary or persistent
files. Remember: persistent files need to be manually copied to the
`tmp-history` repository. So their history will be kept.
====

.You want to generate a random file (in `tmp`) to use it in your script
[%collapsible]
====
----
$ ./generate-random-file.sh
----

To specify the size (length) of the file name use:

----
$ size=5 ./generate-random-file.sh
----

To remove the generated temporary files that have no content, type:

----
$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size 0 -delete
----
====

.You want to publish the contents of your directory `tmp`
[%collapsible]
====
----
$ ./publish-to-gh-pages.sh
----
====

.You can turn some files persistent by copying them from `tmp` to `tmp-history`
[%collapsible]
====
This way they will no longer be temporary and your change history will remain
there (in `tmp-history`).

----
$ cp file1 file2 ../tmp-history
----

NOTE: In the `update-history.sh` script, the `history_dir` variable also points
to a `tmp-history` inside the parent directory of `tmp` repository. So, if your
`tmp-history` directory have a different name, you need to configure this
variable.
====

.You want to rebuild this page (`index.html`) using your own variables
[%collapsible]
====
Create a  file named `my-variables.adoc` and configure the AsciiDoc attributes
`uri-my-*`. This is a sample of how to do this:

----
$ cat > my-variables.adoc <<EOF
:uri-my-domain: https://my-user.github.io/
:uri-my-github: https://github.com/my-user
EOF
----

Rebuild the `index.html` with this command:

----
$ ./README.build.sh
----
