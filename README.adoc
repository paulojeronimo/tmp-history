A Git repository that always contains a single commit and only temporary files.

So, don't expect that you can make a clone of this repository thinking you'll
pull it later because that won't work.

The files generated in this repository are accessible through the URL
https://paulojeronimo.com/tmp/.

*The SHA256 of the temporary files* stored here keeps alive (and constantly
updated) in https://github.com/paulojeronimo/paulojeronimo.github.io/blob/master/tmp-history/changes.txt.
So, you can audit if there was any change in the files pointed out by it.

All the files that are not temporary in this repository are also available in
the directory `tmp-history` pointed by the repo above.

The link:publish-to-gh-pages.sh[] script is responsible for recreating this
repository every time it is called.

The link:generate-random-file.sh[] script is responsible for creating a file
with a random and unique name in this directory. Possibly, the contents of this
file will be encrypted via https://gnupg.org/[GPG].
